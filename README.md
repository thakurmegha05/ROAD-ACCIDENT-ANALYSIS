 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI

1. Overview

This project showcases a fully interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard developed in Power BI. The main objective is to analyze real-world accident data to uncover key patterns and support data-driven decision-making aimed at improving road safety and identifying accident-prone zones.

The dashboard enables users to explore accidents across different dimensions such as time, location, vehicle type, severity, and weather conditions using powerful visualizations and dynamic filters.
2. Key Features
A. Interactive Slicers & Filters

Filter data by year, month, accident severity, state/region, vehicle type, and more

Enables multi-level exploration and comparison of accident data
B. Advanced Time Intelligence

Implemented Time Intelligence functions using DAX such as:

TOTALYTD() for year-to-date accident tracking

DATEADD() for time-based comparisons (e.g., month-over-month, year-over-year)

SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() for historical analysis


These functions allow stakeholders to identify seasonal trends, analyze performance over time, and detect rising/falling patterns in accident rates.
C. Insightful Visualizations

Bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and maps to represent accident metrics

Geo-mapping of accident hotspots across different regions

KPI cards highlighting total accidents, fatalities, average accidents per day, and more
D. Custom DAX Measures

Created calculated columns and measures to derive critical KPIs

Dynamic calculations based on user selections and filter context
E. Clean and Intuitive Layout

Designed with usability in mind, ensuring a smooth analytical experience even for non-technical users
 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

Power Query (for data transformation and cleaning)

Data Modeling with multiple tables and relationships
3. Objective

To build a dashboard that can help:

Traffic departments detect high-risk locations and time periods

Policymakers plan preventive safety measures

Analysts identify root causes and underlying patterns in road accidents

Citizens and stakeholders become more aware of traffic and safety trends
